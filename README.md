# Northwind Database â€“ SQL Project  

This repository contains my **graded project** from the **Hero Vired Certificate Program in Data Analytics**.  
It is based on the **Northwind Database**, a classic dataset used for learning SQL and data analysis.  

The project involves creating the database schema and writing SQL queries to answer business-related questions such as customer orders, top products, revenue, and more.

- Solve real-world style **business queries** on sales and customers.  
- Practice writing clean and correct SQL with proper formatting.
